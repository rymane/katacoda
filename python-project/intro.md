## Introduction
Welcome to this tutorial about continuous integration for a python project.
In this tutorial, we will build a simple [Python](https://www.python.org) project and use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) 
which is a python framework used to write unit test easily. In the last step we will learn how to integrate [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com) which is 
a service for continuous integrations. It is used to continuously build and test code on GitHub or Bitbucket. 

## Goal of this tutorial
By the end of this tutorial you will have:

- Created a simple python project implementing the binary search algorithm.
- Created unit tests with PyTest.
- Connected your fork to Travis CI and learned how to build and test the project automatically.
